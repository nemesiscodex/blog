Hi - I’m Julio Daniel Reyes, a generalist software engineer from Paraguay. Online I go by `nemesiscodex`.

I enjoy building practical, reliable software and exploring systems across the stack. I have more than 12 years of experience, mostly in fintech and education. Day to day I work with Java, Scala, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Rust.

About this site: it’s my place for deep dives, notes, and hands-on guides about software engineering, architecture, and developer workflows. If you find something useful or have a question, feel free to reach out.

Thanks for reading.
